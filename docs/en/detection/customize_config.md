# Tutorial 1: Learn about Configs

We incorporate modular and inheritance design into our config system, which is convenient to conduct various experiments.
If you wish to inspect the config file, you may run `python tools/misc/print_config.py /PATH/TO/CONFIG` to see the complete config.
The detection part of mmfewshot is built upon the [mmdet](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection),
thus it is highly recommended learning the basic of [mmdet](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Modify a config through script arguments

When submitting jobs using "tools/train.py" or "tools/test.py", you may specify `--cfg-options` to in-place modify the config.

- Update config keys of dict chains.

  The config options can be specified following the order of the dict keys in the original config.
  For example, `--cfg-options model.backbone.norm_eval=False` changes the all BN modules in model backbones to `train` mode.

- Update keys inside a list of configs.

  Some config dicts are composed as a list in your config. For example, the training pipeline `data.train.pipeline` is normally a list
  e.g. `[dict(type='LoadImageFromFile'), ...]`. If you want to change `'LoadImageFromFile'` to `'LoadImageFromWebcam'` in the pipeline,
  you may specify `--cfg-options data.train.pipeline.0.type=LoadImageFromWebcam`.

- Update values of list/tuples.

  If the value to be updated is a list or a tuple. For example, the config file normally sets `workflow=[('train', 1)]`. If you want to
  change this key, you may specify `--cfg-options workflow="[(train,1),(val,1)]"`. Note that the quotation mark " is necessary to
  support list/tuple data types, and that **NO** white space is allowed inside the quotation marks in the specified value.

## Config file naming convention

We follow the below style to name config files. Contributors are advised to follow the same style.

```
{model}_[model setting]_{backbone}_{neck}_[norm setting]_[misc]_[gpu x batch_per_gpu]_{dataset}_{data setting}
```

`{xxx}` is required field and `[yyy]` is optional.

- `{model}`: model type like `faster_rcnn`, `mask_rcnn`, etc.
- `[model setting]`: specific setting for some model, like `contrastive-loss` for `fsce`, etc.
- `{backbone}`: backbone type like `r50` (ResNet-50), `x101` (ResNeXt-101).
- `{neck}`: neck type like `fpn`,  `c4`.
- `[norm_setting]`: `bn` (Batch Normalization) is used unless specified, other norm layer type could be `gn` (Group Normalization), `syncbn` (Synchronized Batch Normalization).
  `gn-head`/`gn-neck` indicates GN is applied in head/neck only, while `gn-all` means GN is applied in the entire model, e.g. backbone, neck, head.
- `[misc]`: miscellaneous setting/plugins of model, e.g. `dconv`, `gcb`, `attention`, `albu`, `mstrain`.
- `[gpu x batch_per_gpu]`: GPUs and samples per GPU, `8xb2` is used by default.
- `{dataset}`: dataset like `coco`, `voc-split1`, `voc-split2` and `voc-split3`.
- `{data setting}`: like `base-training` or `1shot-fine-tuning`.

## An example of TFA

To help the users have a basic idea of a complete config and the modules in a modern detection system,
we make brief comments on the config of TFA in coco 10 shot fine-tuning setting as the following.
For more detailed usage and the corresponding alternative for each module, please refer to the API documentation.

## FAQ

### Use intermediate variables in configs

Some intermediate variables are used in the configs files, like `train_pipeline`/`test_pipeline` in datasets.
It's worth noting that when modifying intermediate variables in the children configs, user need to pass the intermediate variables into corresponding fields again.
For example, we would like to use multi scale strategy to train a Mask R-CNN. `train_pipeline`/`test_pipeline` are intermediate variable we would like modify.

```python
_base_ = './faster_rcnn_r50_caffe_fpn.py'
img_norm_cfg = dict(
    mean=[123.675, 116.28, 103.53], std=[58.395, 57.12, 57.375], to_rgb=True)
train_pipeline = [
    dict(type='LoadImageFromFile'),
    dict(type='LoadAnnotations', with_bbox=True, with_mask=True),
    dict(
        type='Resize',
        img_scale=[(1333, 640), (1333, 672), (1333, 704), (1333, 736),
                   (1333, 768), (1333, 800)],
        multiscale_mode="value",
        keep_ratio=True),
    dict(type='RandomFlip', flip_ratio=0.5),
    dict(type='Normalize', **img_norm_cfg),
    dict(type='Pad', size_divisor=32),
    dict(type='DefaultFormatBundle'),
    dict(type='Collect', keys=['img', 'gt_bboxes', 'gt_labels', 'gt_masks']),
]
test_pipeline = [
    dict(type='LoadImageFromFile'),
    dict(
        type='MultiScaleFlipAug',
        img_scale=(1333, 800),
        flip=False,
        transforms=[
            dict(type='Resize', keep_ratio=True),
            dict(type='RandomFlip'),
            dict(type='Normalize', **img_norm_cfg),
            dict(type='Pad', size_divisor=32),
            dict(type='ImageToTensor', keys=['img']),
            dict(type='Collect', keys=['img']),
        ])
]
data = dict(
    train=dict(pipeline=train_pipeline),
    val=dict(pipeline=test_pipeline),
    test=dict(pipeline=test_pipeline))
```

We first define the new `train_pipeline`/`test_pipeline` and pass them into `data`.

Similarly, if we would like to switch from `SyncBN` to `BN` or `MMSyncBN`, we need to substitute every `norm_cfg` in the config.

```python
_base_ = './faster_rcnn_r50_caffe_fpn.py'
norm_cfg = dict(type='BN', requires_grad=True)
model = dict(
    backbone=dict(norm_cfg=norm_cfg),
    neck=dict(norm_cfg=norm_cfg),
    ...)
```
